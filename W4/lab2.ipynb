    "For this week, you will look at techniques to prepare data and build models for text generation. You will train a neural network with lyrics from an Irish song then let it make a new song for you. Though this might sound like a more complex application, you'll soon see that the process is very similar to the ones you've been using in the previous weeks. Only minor modifications are needed. Let's see what these are in the next sections."
